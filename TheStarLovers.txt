The Star Lovers by Grace James

All you that are true lovers, I beseech you to pray to the gods for fair weather upon the seventh night of the seventh moon.

For patience’s sake and for dear love’s sake, pray, and be pitiful that upon that night there may be neither rain, nor hail, nor cloud, nor thunder, nor creeping mist.

Hear the sad tale of the Star Lovers and give them your prayers.
